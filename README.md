## Why use Board Game Discovery?
Everyone loves playing board games, but deciding which one to play or buy can be difficult with the never-ending options to chose from. 

Using Board Game Discovery allows you to narrow down your search based off of specific game criteria and since Board Game Discovery is an open database, you can also add your favorite games for others to discover!

## Functionality
Using the 5 drop-downs on the home page, narrow down your board game search. Simply select the single drop-down that you want to use as your filter and hit "submit". All of the games matching that specific criteria are then listed below. 

Optionally, you can use all 5 drop-downs and hit "submit" for the most stream-lined search results. 

Please note, that the Board Game Discovery database is very small so there are not too many results when using all 5 drop-downs. To see how it works though, try selecting the following drop-down options in order to return "Jenga" as the search result:

* Category : Family
* Age Group : Less than 8 yrs old
* Difficulty : Intermediate
* Number of Players : 4
* Game Length : 20 - 29 min.

In order to add a game to the database, simply click on the "Add A Game" icon on the bottom of the home page and you will be redirected to the "Add A Game" page. Complete all form fields and click the "Add Game" button.

Enjoy discovering new board games and never be bored again!
